-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Brushymilbil,

- I'm currently not interested in anything in particular, but if I had to choose, it would be the .NET ecosystem.
- I am always learning something new, even when using things that I use daily.
- I am currently learning about .NET and all of its features. I created a couple of prototypes on my PC using WPF, WinForms, and UWP.
  
- Some of the languages I can work with:
  - HTML
  - JavaScript (a little rusty; it's been a while)
  - CSS
  - C#
  - XAML
  - Kotlin (still learning though)
  - Python (same thing as JavaScript; it's been a while)
  - Lua
  
- The language I use the most would be C#. Second would be XAML, and third place goes to Lua.
- I've always dreamt of having my own language one day. It doesn't matter if no one uses it, as long as I made it.
- So, in my free time, I work on a language from time to time (it's far from finished, very complicated, and frustrating, but a lot of fun!).

- I forget a lot of stuff sometimes (even the difference between return and continue:O).
- This was my first line of code ever, in my starting language Lua: `Print("Hello World!")`
- That would also work in Python, so if I didn't specify the language, you'd probably think it was Python.

- Now, dearest friends, let us venture into the mysterious world of technology together as we find new and innovative ways to 'upgrade' our world!
- Thanks for stopping by!
