-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Brushymilbil,
- I am always learning something new, even when using things that I use daily..
  
- The language I use the most is C#.
- I forget a lot of stuff sometimes (even the difference between return and continue:O).
  
- This was my first line of code ever, in my starting language Lua: `Print("Hello World!")`
  That would also work in Python, so if I didn't specify the language, you'd probably think it was Python.

- Thanks for stopping by!
